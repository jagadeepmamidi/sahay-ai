## 🚨 Problem Statement

### The Information Gap Crisis

Millions of deserving farmers in India remain unaware of government welfare schemes designed to support them. The **Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)** scheme alone aims to benefit **12.5 crore farmer families**, yet many face critical barriers:

- **📚 Lack of Awareness**: Farmers don't know about schemes they're eligible for
- **📄 Complex Documentation**: Official documents are dense and difficult to understand  
- **🔄 Cumbersome Processes**: Application procedures can be daunting, especially for those with limited digital literacy
- **🌐 Language Barriers**: Information is often not available in local languages

This leads to **chronic underutilization** of benefits designed to improve livelihoods and promote social equity.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** installed on your system
- **IBM WatsonX Account** with API credentials
- **Git** for cloning the repository

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sahay-ai-hackathon.git
cd sahay-ai-hackathon
```

### 2️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env
```

Add your IBM WatsonX credentials to the `.env` file:

```env
# IBM WatsonX Credentials
WATSONX_API_KEY=your_watsonx_api_key_here
WATSONX_PROJECT_ID=your_watsonx_project_id_here
```

> **🔐 Security Note:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Prepare the Knowledge Base

Place the PM-KISAN PDF document in the `data/` directory and run the ingestion pipeline:

```bash
# Copy the PM-KISAN PDF to the data directory
cp PMKisanSamanNidhi.PDF data/pm_kisan_rules.pdf

# Run the data ingestion pipeline
python src/ingest.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
🚀 Starting Sahay AI Data Ingestion Pipeline
==================================================
📄 Loading PDF document...
✅ Successfully loaded 4 pages from PDF
✂️  Splitting text into chunks...

```

### 5️⃣ Launch the Application

```bash
# Start the Streamlit web application
streamlit run src/app.py
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501` 🎉

## 📖 Usage Guide

### 💬 Using the Chat Interface

1. **Start a Conversation**: Type your question about PM-KISAN in the input box
2. **Get Instant Answers**: Sahay AI will process your query and provide accurate information
3. **Continue Chatting**: Ask follow-up questions naturally
4. **Use Sample Questions**: Click on sidebar buttons for common queries

### 📝 Example Conversations

**User**: "What is PM-KISAN scheme?"  
**Sahay AI**: "PM-KISAN is the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme launched by the Government of India to supplement the financial needs of Small and Marginal Farmers (SMFs)..."

**User**: "How much money do farmers receive?"  
**Sahay AI**: "Under the PM-KISAN scheme, eligible landholding SMF families receive a direct payment of Rs. 6000 per year, transferred in three equal installments of Rs. 2000 each every four months..."

### 🎯 Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Ask clear, focused questions about PM-KISAN
- **One Topic**: Ask one question at a time for best results  
- **Use Keywords**: Include terms like "eligibility", "benefits", "application", etc.
- **Follow Up**: Ask clarifying questions based on the responses

## 🔧 Development & Customization

### 🧪 Testing the Agent

You can test the agent functionality directly:

```bash
# Test the agent with sample queries
python src/agent.py
```

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability

All interactions are logged in `logs/interactions.jsonl`:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-10T15:30:45.123456+00:00",
  "user_query": "What is PM-KISAN scheme?",
  "retrieved_context": ["Context chunk 1...", "Context chunk 2..."],
  "agent_response": "PM-KISAN is a Central Sector Scheme..."
}
```

### 🎨 Customizing the Interface

The Streamlit interface can be customized by modifying `src/app.py`:
- Update CSS styles in the `initialize_streamlit_config()` function
- Add new features in the main application flow
- Modify the sidebar content and sample questions

### 📄 Adding New Documents

To add more government scheme documents:

1. Place PDF files in the `data/` directory
2. Modify `src/ingest.py` to process multiple documents
3. Update the agent prompt to handle broader scheme coverage
